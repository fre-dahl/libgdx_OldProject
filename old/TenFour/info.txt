The program should should run in it's current state. You should see foreground, the black box and a white background.

I am including the external gdx - libraries i am using in a lib folder within the project. Not using gradle or the gdx project setup.
I never got this to work so i add the libraries manually.

I hope this doesn't make it very inconvenient

You move around with mouse (click and zoom) or keys (up,left,down,right or w,a,s,d)

You start the program in "playstate". where a world gets initialized. You can generate a new world with SPACE from "playstate".
ESCAPE takes you to the "menustate" and ENTER takes you to "playstate". ESCAPE from the "menustate" exits the program.

You can turn on/off layers in components.Gameworld - newArea() : DrwHandler.instance.set(n,boolean);

layer 1 is the black box layer.
layer 2 is clouds
layer 3 is foreground

you can remove the renderFbo() method in graphics.DrwHandler by commenting out the following:

if (i==1) { renderFbo(i); }
                else{
                    for (DrwDat dat: layers.get(i)) {
                        dat.draw(batch);
                    }
                }

and replacing it with:

(DrwDat dat: layers.get(i)) { dat.draw(batch);}
